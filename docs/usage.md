# Usage

Just make a `docs` directory in your Github project repository and put an `index.md` file in there to get started. Then browse to:

	http://<github-username>.viewdocs.io/<repository-name>

Any other Markdown files in your `docs` directory are available as a subpath, including files in directories. You can update pages by just pushing to your repository or editing directly on Github. It can take up to 1-2 minutes before changes will appear.

You can also customize the look and layout of your docs. Make your own `docs/template.html` based on the [default template](https://github.com/progrium/viewdocs/blob/master/docs/template.html) and your pages will be rendered with that template.
